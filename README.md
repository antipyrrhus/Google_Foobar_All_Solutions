This contains solutions for all 5 levels of the Foobar challenge (some levels contain more than one question each). All solutions were accepted and verified as valid by Google. Naturally, the challenge tends to get more difficult the higher the level.

The problem description for each question is noted near the top of each .java file. Some of the algorithm and data structure concepts employed in the solutions include:

- Sets and Maps
- Frequency count
- Binary search
- Recursion with memoization
- Dynamic programming
- XOR
- Dijkstra, BFS, DFS
- Max Flow / Min Cut, Ford-Fulkerson (with multiple source and multiple sink nodes)
- Graph theory (directed graph, clique, etc.)
- Floyd-Warshall (all-pair shortest path)
- Cycles and permutations
- Burnside's Lemma

To check the solution to a particular problem, invoke the static answer() method contained within the corresponding file (with relevant input parameters).
